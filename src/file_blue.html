      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p class="filep">
        Jacqueline Bleu, while a fairly new Wacky Criminal added to the WCD, is
        responsible for multiple accounts of inconveniences, especially in
        locations inappropriate for such behavior caused via her Wackness.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Glowing</h2>
        <p class="filep">
          Jacqueline Bleu has the ability to glow a bright blue light,
          illuminating everything around her, measured to be around
          <em>15ft.</em>
          While at first seeming harmless, anything illuminated by the blue
          light begins to inexplicably move slowly towards Bleu, including
          inanimate objects.
        </p>
        <p class="filep">
          Living organisms also seem to be affected by the blue light, and
          appear to enter a trance-like state, unable to respond and walking
          slowly towards Bleu until given physical stimulus. When released from
          the trance, most victims point out the smell of hummus lingering in
          their minds.

        <h2>Hummuscide</h2>
        <p class="filep">Usually committed after she glows.</p>
        <p class="crim_quote">
          <q>I like the bounce.</q>
        </p>
        <p class="filep">
          This is possibly referring to the fact that due to the weight of the
          coins and bills within the machines, they begin to bounce around, then
          ultimately self-destruct. The only thing that indicates that this
          crime is about to be committed is
          <em>when Redmann asks for some cash.</em>
        </p>

        <h2>Methods of Capture</h2>
        <p class="filep">
          Despite frequently breaking out and committing more unsual and wacky
          crimes, Redmann always complies and does not require the use of a
          ROWCC when capturing. However, <em>DO NOT</em> under any circumstances
          approach him, or else you'll risk becoming a victim of one of his
          various crimes. Simply call a professional to deal with him and leave
          the premises as soon as possible.
