      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p class="filep">
        Jacqueline Bleu, while a fairly new Wacky Criminal added to the WCD, is
        responsible for multiple accounts of inconveniences, especially in
        locations inappropriate for such behavior caused via her Wackness. It is
        also noted that she is an avid fan of hummus.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Glowing</h2>
        <p class="filep">
          Jacqueline Bleu has the ability to glow a bright blue light,
          illuminating everything around her, measured to be around
          <em>15ft.</em>
          While at first seeming harmless, anything illuminated by the blue
          light begins to inexplicably move slowly towards Bleu, including
          inanimate objects.
        </p>
        <p class="filep">
          Living organisms also seem to be affected by the blue light, and
          appear to
          <em> enter a trance-like state, unable to respond</em> while walking
          slowly towards Bleu until given physical stimulus. When released from
          the trance, most victims point out the smell of hummus lingering in
          their minds.

        <h2>Hummuscide</h2>
        <p class="filep">
          Through unknown circumstances, whenever Bleu comes into physical
          contact with a container of hummus, it somehow gets
          <q>obliterated</q>, as some witnesses claim. Regardless, the sound
          created by this phenomena is
          <em>enough to shatter eardrums,</em> usually leaving victims
          hospitalized for a couple weeks.
        </p>

        <h2>Methods of Capture</h2>
        <p class="filep">
          When dealing with Jacqueline Bleu, it is noted that the most effective
          method of luring her is with a small container of hummus. Place the
          hummus in a location far from both yourself and others in order to
          prevent the risk of being affected by <em>Hummuscide.</em> For this
          same reason, using the ROWCC is the safest way to capture her.
