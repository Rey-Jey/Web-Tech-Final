      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p class="filep">
        Walter White is an <em>INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS</em> Wacky Criminal. While
        there is evidence that he is dead, there have been sightings of him all
        across the country. It is for this reason that this page will remain
        open in the case that you have an encounter with White.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Candy Trade</h2>
        <p class="filep">
          When White was still active, he had incredible skill in candymaking.
          Victims who had consumed his candy described feelings such as
          <q>happiness</q>, <q>elation</q>, and often <q>bliss</q>. While at
          first relatively harmless, these victims quickly grew an alarming
          dependence on this candy. Exhbiting signs of rage or depression if
          they hadn't eaten it for a while.
        </p>
        <p class="filep">
          Furthermore, White had secured a spot within an expansive candy trade that spanned the
          entire world. This, combined with the side effects of consuming his candy, caused a world wide epidemic where <em>rage-induced citizens would slap each other after not consuming White's candy for a short period of time</em>.
        </p>
        <p class="filep">
          To combat this, the WCD issued a world wide lockdown in order to reduce the amount of slappings. After White's death, the epidemic eventually died down, although many victims are still hospitalized by the slappings to this day. 
        </p>

        <p>Film makers have started production of a movie inspired by the events of the slappings:</p>

        <h2>
          Existing in the Peripheral Dimension <small>(speculation)</small>
        </h2>
        <p class="filep">
          Whether through mass hysteria, or an eerie coincidence, the WCD has
          collected over <em>1 million</em> reports regarding sightings of
          White, despite the fact that there is evidence of his death. Although
          strange indeed, what's even stranger is every report claims to see
          his figure <q>out of the corner of [their] eye.</q> When looking towards the direction of the figure, it usually disappears.
        </p>
        <p class="filep">
          The leading theory of this phenomenon is that White's candy has caused
          some long-term side effects, one of them being that his form appears within someone's peripheral vision. However, this is just a theory, and measures must be put into place to ensure that the community is safe from Walter White. For this reason alone:
          <p class="crim_quote">
          <em
            >The WCD has issued a state of emergency to
            <q>always look with intent.</q> Do not stare blankly, Do not allow White to appear within
            your peripheral vision</em
          >
        </p>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Methods of Capture</h2>
        <p class="filep">
          When encountering White, <em>DO NOT</em> attempt to lure or capture
          him by yourself. Immediately attempt to leave the scene and call a
          professional Collector to handle him.
        </p>
        <p class="filep">
          If you ever see Walter White in your peripheral vision,
          <em>IMMEDIATELY</em> turn towards him, since most reports of his
          sightings usually ended with the victim actively looking towards the
          spot he was in.
