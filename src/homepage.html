          The WCD records all information about unusual and weird crimes. Any
          crime that is deemed <q>out of the ordinary</q> or
          <q>impossible by normal standards</q> should be reported to us
          immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          All information on known wacky criminals are kept in our encrypted
          database, which you can access for your own safety purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Database is updated at <time>12:00 am</time> every Friday. If you

        <h2>Restrain</h2>
        <p>
          All criminals in this database are <em>DANGEROUS</em> and should be
          captured as soon as possible. If you spot anyone committing unusual or
          wacky crimes, please send us a report.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, these criminals are a <em>THREAT</em> to regular citizens, so
          if you must, it may be up to you to restrain the criminal yourself.
          Information on how to subdue a wacky criminal can be found

        <h2>Retrieve</h2>
        <p>
          Due to the wacky nature of these criminals, breakouts from our
          facility are frequent. So we must practice our retrieve and restrain
          mindset. If you have spotted any of the criminals in this database.
