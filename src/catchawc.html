    <p class="catchawc">
      Using information gathered from the WCD, safely lure the Wacky Criminal to
      an isolated location. Make sure to maintain a safe distance from the
      criminal to ensure maximum safety.

    <h2>3. Capture the Criminal</h2>
    <img src="images/ROWCC.png" alt="a ROWCC" class="responsive" />
    <p class="catchawc">
      Make sure you have a
      <q>Radial Oscillating Wacky Criminal Collector</q> (ROWCC). If you don't
      currently have a ROWCC, <em>DO NOT</em> engage the criminal, await help
      from a professional WCD specialist. Furthermore, ensure that the ROWCC
      will be an effective tool. Not all Wacky Criminals can be captured using
      the ROWCC.
    </p>

    <p class="catchawc">
      If you do have a ROWCC however. Maintain a safe distance from the Wacky
      Criminal before activating the ROWCC, then throw it at the Wacky Criminal.
      Make sure the ROWCC hits them. For the highest success rate, aim for the
      center of the Wacky Criminal's chest.
    </p>
    <p class="catchawc">
      The ROWCC retains the captured criminal for 2 days before releasing them.

      Every street has a <q>Wacky Criminal Collection Station</q>. Please make
      your way to one of these stations as soon as you've captured the Wacky
      Criminal in order to reduce risk of the criminal escaping again.
